# Project Manager

We are looking for Sourcegraph's first internal Project Manager to help us coordinate large-scale projects across the business. From new product launches, marketing campaigns, product pricing changes, and more, you will help our product, engineering, marketing, sales, customer engineering, and operations teams coordinate their efforts to execute flawlessly.

Our team and our sales are growing fast—we’ve proven strong product-market fit, with wall-to-wall usage and top-tier engagement, genuine love from our users and customers, and tens of thousands of paid daily active users at some of the world’s premier development teams.

## Responsibilities

You will help make a variety of large-scale cross-team projects successful. Example projects include:

### Helping us launch our Campaigns product

[Sourcegraph Campaigns](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/campaigns) will allow our users to execute large-scale code changes across many repositories and code hosts. As we prepare to launch this product from beta to general availability, we need a Project Manager to help coordinate across every team at Sourcegraph. You will organize regular stand-ups, build a project plan and checklist, help set timelines for everyone to execute to, ensure our product team has the release announcement ready, ensure our marketing and sales teams have the right messaging to describe the product value, help our customer engineering team learn to deliver a product demo, and more.

### Updating our planning process

Our finance team is kicking off a new planning and budgeting process for next year. While in the past, such planning has largely been top-down, this year the responsibilities will be highly distributed, with each department lead (and potentially team manager) helping to build out the growth plan for their organization. You will help the finance team sketch out and manage the process, collect feedback from the leadership team, and ensure each participant completes their plan on time.

### Changing product pricing

As we grow, our pricing model will continue to evolve. You will help our customer-facing teams build the case for the change, manage the internal decision-making process by creating a [request for comment (RFC)](../../communication/rfcs/index.md), create a timeline and project plan, coordinate with our business opeations team to analyze market data, ensure our finance team has modeled the impact to the business, coordinate messaging with our product and sales teams, and ensure each of our customers and prospects receives the update.

### Roll out new tools

You will help departments and our internal tools team manage the selection and rollout of new internal tools. You will help establish a project plan, help identify and evaluate options or vendors, build a rollout timeline, establish training sessions (if necessary), and update our internal processes and our handbook.

## Qualifications

- 2+ years experience in a role that emphasizes organization, cross-functional collaboration, change management, and project ownership and leadership, such as project or program management, consulting, or similar.
- Be a self-starter. We are a small team, and we are counting on you to help identify and prioritize where you can have the greatest impact.
- Demonstrated success and impact while working at or with a fast-growing startup or medium-sized software company.
