# Demo Instances 
Currently (as of Jan 2021) we have 3 different Sourcegraph instances that we use to demo the product to prospects and customers. Our goal is to eventually
have all demos take place on demo.sourcegraph.com, but until it has feature parity with the other instances, we must switch between the following instances to
fully demonstrate Sourcegraph's feature set and use cases. 

## Current Demo Instances (Jan 2021):

### Instance | Owner | Feature Set | When to use
- sourcegraph.com | n/a | search, intel, monitoring | General demos
- demo.sourcegraph.com | CE team | search, intel, campaigns | Campaigns demos
- k8s.sgdev.com | Eng | search, intel, insights | Advanced/experimental features 

## Future Plans:
We will get demo.sourcegraph.com up to full feature parity with the other instances in order to allow CEs to use that sole instance for all product demos
