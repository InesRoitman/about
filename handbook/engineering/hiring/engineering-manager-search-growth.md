# Engineering Manager - Search growth team

As our [search team plans to split](../search/index.md#growth-plan), we are looking for an engineering manager to build and lead our [Search growth](../search/index.md#search-growth) team.

The team will own unlocking new use cases of Sourcegraph search and improving adoption and retention of Sourcegraph search features for Cloud and Enerprise users alike, through projecs such as:

- Adding [code monitoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_R5DgpUkxyZilsJ9vBQm5cvRPT2udc3tZIPg2q3cnZU/edit) capabilities to Sourcegraph
- Improving user onboarding to the Sourcegraph query language
- Making Sourcegraph search aware of [contexs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlxy7Fy19Q2yua7Fjg0xCda1c07f9RoR8rXxU22Ni60/edit) that help users search through the code they care about

While some engineers will join the Search growth team immediately following the split, the team will likely need to grow to achieve its goals, and you own defining hiring needs and execuing on them.

- Regularly communicate the team's progress toward their goals as well as changes in team goals to appropriate stakeholders.
- Support and coach teammates to grow in their careers and fulfill their responsibilities.
- Grow the team in a sustainable way so that the team can accomplish more over time.

## Qualifications

- You have 2+ years of experience directly managing at least 4 full-time software engineers. We expect you already know how to lead a team.
- You have done some amount of coding in the past 2 years (for example: at work or on a personal project) to keep your skills up-to-date. We expect that you are able to review and provide valuable feedback on code, architecture, and designs.
- You are able to clearly communicate your past accomplishments verbally (example: in an interview) and in writing (examples: in your resume, in your answers to our application questions).
- You have experience breaking up complex technical problems into smaller achievable milestones that the team can iterate on.
