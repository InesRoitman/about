# Campaigns goals and roadmap

## Goals
1) Campaigns is GA by <xxx> and generates N1 REVENUE
2) Campaigns has shown some traction in the OSS community


**Problem**
Campaign creates value for early adopters, but its current target user base is limited. To achieve our vision of making universal search (and replace) available to every developer in the world, we need to address two challenges.
First, Campaigns does not support the use cases, environment and scale of all of Sourcegraph's existing enterprise user base.
Second, Campaigns is currently Enterprise only and hence cannot create value for the broader community.

**Value to Sourcegraph**
If we successfully address those challenges, it will:
- *Grow usage within an account (# users)*. A campaign can affect all the repositories of an organization, so every developer will know about and derive value from Campaigns.
- *Increase stickiness and revenue*. Campaigns can become embedded in the development workflow.
- *Drive Sourcegraph adoption*: the Open Source community will be aware of Sourcegraph.


## Milestones and Outcomes

1. Campaigns can support the environment (code host, integrations, local env) of xx % of the user base

2. Campaigns can handle the scale of xx% of the user base

3. Customers can create successful large scale changesets (<500+> changesets)
Metric: We can execute a campaign of <xxx> changesets in less than <xxx> time
Metric: We have <xxx> users with campaigns of <xxx> PRs changesets or more

4. Campaign users can manage large changesets (<500+> changesets)
Metric: <UX metric?>
Metric: We have <xxx> users with campaigns of <xxx> changesets or more

5. Campaign creators can get campaigns merged more effectively with sourcegraph than with anybody else
Metric: <TODO>
(Most of it currently bucketed into Managing Campaigns.)


6. Campaigns is GA
Outcome: Public Pricing
Outcome: Personas of Campaign Customers
Outcome: 3 business cases (simple and complex use cases, on monorepos, etc)
Outcome: <xxx> % customer base adoption and N1 revenue metric

7. Campaigns onboarding is smooth and self-serve
A metric to be defined with CE

8. Campaigns has early traction for OSS use
Metric:Campaigns creates value for 3 open source project maintainers
